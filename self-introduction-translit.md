My name is Marina Golubeva. I live in Volgograd. And you are looking my self introduction.

### My education ###

I finished “Volgograd State Social Pedagogical University” at Faculty Maths and Information Technologies with honors degree in 2000 year. Next year I got Master's degree.
I have work experience in IT for 21 years.

I started my career as Delphi programmer. But for this work I needed to know MySQL software development, so I am MySQL developer too.
Then I wrote a site for information system of University, where I worked about 10 years. The site was written with the help of wiki technology. This technology is the parent of modern CMS.

If you don’t know what is table layout sit down comfortably. I can tell you. It was a joke of course.

During some years I was studying and working in different CMS, for example: Typo3 (it was my work project), Joomla, WordPress, OpenCart, Drupal.
During last 10 years I was working in bitrix CMS. The main types of these sites are educational portals, site of bank, catalogs and different internet stores.

The most interesting projects of last six months were.

- First one is “Parsing of cities and regions in Russia from Wikipedia”. It was interesting project for me, because I like to travel in our country. I have a dream to make a website. Where people can create their routes.
- Second project that I would like to introduce is “Customization of bitrix support module”. There were rewritten blocks:
    - Generation of users` requests from letters.
    - Calculation of support deadline with considering work schedule, holidays and weekends.
  Seven factories in Russia are working with the help of this module in case of my company. Thanks to this module, my company saves money every year.
- Third project that is very remarkable is introduction “Credit in basket from Sber”. It is backend elaboration. And frontend interaction with clients.
- And finally, project that does not belong to my work: site-aggregator, which collects knitting patterns from free resources. The base of my site is daily parsing of schemes of knitting and crochet.

All my work experience is backend development. My hard skills are: GIT, HTML, CSS, PHP and jquery – I knew and used during my work.
But I am always interested in magic of frontend. It used to be wonderful interacting with clients without restarting page. I am interested on frontend so I get "Java Script" course in RS School.
And for this moment my strong sides are SASS, BEM, Java Script. It is very useful and I would like to continue.
